side of the Bifröst.

I had to implement a keyboard listener, and add a funky way to set the focus on my window
to actually listen to the keyboard. I also had to import and draw with Images and have
collision detection, as well as daggers to come out and kill the enemy. I also had to implement a timer to animate the game. Setting a way to die and pause the game was unique too.
Overall, a good learning curve was needed
